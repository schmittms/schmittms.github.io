            Eventually I will upload my notes for random methods from statistics or physics that I have come across over the years. To keep you busy in the meantime, I am providing links and short descriptions to some of my favorite recordings of all time.
            More will be added soon as I work my way through my list of liked videos on Youtube!

                <p>
                    If I were to be sent to a desert island and could only take one recording with me to listen to for the rest of my life, it might well be this one. In fact I am so paranoid about losing this recording that I downloaded it as an mp3 just for safekeeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He plays the Scarlatti almost romantically. This may not be for everyone, but I love it. 
                    He also brings so much depth to the Schumann that even if I listen to it once, I will have the theme (and many variations!) stuck in my head for a week, much to Nika's dismay.

                <p>
                    This recording is typical Horowitz, capturing every voice and bringing them out in a way nobody else can. 
                    The syncopation and clarity he brings at ~2:13 is something I have never heard anyone else replicate.

                <h3>Scriabin + Nikolayeva</h3>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Horowitz (see above), Nikolayeva's Scriabin sounds almost cozy. It feels a bit like you're at the bottom of the ocean. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I especially like how she plays the very tail end of the transition in Op. 42 No. 5 at 9:24-9:25 (music shown at left). She builds up until the very last second (on the E), almost completely disregarding the diminuendo at the beginning of the measure.

                    Great third movement by Zimerman, so much energy! Very good listening for fast runs.
                    He also shows some excellent facial expressions (e.g. at 30:57).

                <h3>Horowitz Improvising, etc.</h3>
                <p>
                    Why does improvisation seem so rare among professional pianists?
                    If I recall correctly, cadenzas used to be totally improvised.
                    Even after that practice largely stopped in favor of prewritten cadenzas, there are famous anecdotes of Liszt improvising in concerts, or Schumann improvising "vignettes" of his friends at parties. 
                    I am sure many pianists today can also improvise (though maybe not quite like Horowitz...). I wish they would!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This recording also has some funny exchanges between Horowitz and the sound engineer.

                    For many years this recording was my morning alarm. 
                    Unfortunately, as a consequence I dread that initial a minor chord to this day.

                <p>
                    I admittedly came to the Erlkönig story from the wrong starting point (via Liszt), and so for me the music was largely detached from Goethe's poem. 
                    Only when I saw this video did I get the full, scary, picture behind the music.

                <p>
                    Nyiregyhazi is a relatively unknown pianist. He lived a very sad life but was talented. It's unfortunate that there are not more recordings from him.
                    I didn't understand the Faust symphony until I heard it played on piano. The Gretchen theme is very beautiful.

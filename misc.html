            Eventually I will upload notes for random methods from statistics or physics that I have come across over the years. To keep you busy in the meantime, I am providing links and short descriptions to some of my favorite recordings of all time.
            More will be added soon as I work my way through my list of liked videos on Youtube!

                <h3>Horowitz Improvising, etc.</h3>
                <p>
                    Why does improvisation seem so rare among professional pianists?
                    If I recall correctly, cadenzas used to be totally improvised.
                    Even after that practice largely stopped in favor of prewritten cadenzas, there are famous anecdotes of Liszt improvising in concerts, or Schumann improvising "vignettes" of his friends at parties. 
                    I am sure many pianists today can also improvise (though maybe not quite like Horowitz...). I wish they would!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This recording also has some funny exchanges between Horowitz and the sound engineer.

                <h3>Erlkönig Sand Art</h3>
                <p>
                    I admittedly came to the Erlkönig story from the wrong starting point (via Liszt), and so for me the music was largely detached from Goethe's poem. 
                    Only when I saw this video did I get the full, scary, picture behind the music.

                    Recently, I was discussing the poem with Nika.
